# 1. Import datasets
# a) ANC4 and SBA coverage data (2018â€“2022)

# b) Country classification (on-track / off-track)

# c) Population projections (estimated births in 2022)
# Import Estimates sheet

# 2. Data cleaning

# a) Clean indicators data
# Remove rows with missing geographic area
# (Note: When importing Excel files, extra NA rows are sometimes added at the end.
# In this case, after reviewing the dataset, there is one NA row at the end that needs to be removed.)
indicators <- indicators[!is.na(indicators$`Geographic area`), ]
